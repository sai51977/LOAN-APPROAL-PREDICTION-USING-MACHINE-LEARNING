# LOAN-APPROAL-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
🚀 Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, education, credit history, and loan amount.

The goal is to automate the traditional manual loan approval process, making it faster, more accurate, and unbiased.
